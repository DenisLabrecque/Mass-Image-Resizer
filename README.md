# Mass Image Resizer Utility
I made this simple console app to allow resizing all my Jekyll website images to thumbnails with a custom suffix name in one fell swoop.

Just run `ImageResizer.exe` in the folder you want images resized. The program will resize all images in that folder and in subfolders, skipping images that would otherwise be resized larger by the operation.
